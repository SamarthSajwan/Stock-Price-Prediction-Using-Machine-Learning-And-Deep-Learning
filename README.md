# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-And-Deep-Learning
Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction – physical factors vs. psychological, rational and irrational behavior, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy.  Using Time Series Forecasting, which is the process of analyzing time series data using statistics and modelling to make predictions and inform strategic decision-making, I have tried to predict the future stock price based on its historical data.

Broadly, stock market analysis is divided into two parts: <br>
•	Fundamental Analysis:  involves analyzing the company’s future profitability on the basis of its current business environment and financial performance.<br>
•	Technical Analysis: on the other hand, includes reading the charts and using statistical figures to identify the trends in the stock market.
 <br>
 
 ### <b>Time Series Forecasting using ML and DL </b>deals with the technical analysis aspect of this problem.
 <br>
 
In this project, I have worked with historical data about the stock prices of a publicly listed company. <b>I implemented a mix of machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock price of this company, starting with simple algorithms like averaging and linear regression, and then moved on to advanced techniques like Auto ARIMA, Prophet and LSTM. </b>

### All the graphs are plotted using the Matplotlib.pyplot module of the Matplotlib library in Python, with the following colors representing:<br>
o	Blue: Values in the Training Set of Data<br>
o	Orange: Values in the Testing Set of Data<br>
o	Green: Predicted values by the model of the testing set.<br>


Below are all the curves of the 6 models made using matplotlib :  <br>

### 1) Moving Averages
